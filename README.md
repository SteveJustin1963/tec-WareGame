A text war game running on the tec1, what!


Excellent question — designing a **text-based wargame** benefits enormously from a solid conceptual model before you start coding. Let’s outline both the **approach** and two visuals: an **ASCII flowchart** and a **state diagram**.

---

## 🧭 1. Approach Overview

Here’s a clear, layered way to approach a text-based wargame (works equally well for historical, sci-fi, or fantasy settings):

### **Step 1. Define Core Entities**

* **Player**: name, army strength, morale, resources.
* **Enemy**: same attributes, possibly multiple enemies.
* **Battlefield**: terrain, time of day, weather.
* **Turn System**: player and AI alternate turns.
* **Command System**: typed commands like `attack`, `defend`, `scout`, `retreat`, `status`.

### **Step 2. Game Loop**

Each loop iteration = one **turn**:

1. Display status.
2. Ask for player command.
3. Process command → update states.
4. Execute enemy AI response.
5. Check win/loss/continue conditions.

### **Step 3. Modularize**

Group functions logically:

* `init_game()` — setup armies and map.
* `player_turn()` — handle input and actions.
* `enemy_turn()` — simulate AI.
* `resolve_battle()` — apply casualties & morale.
* `check_end()` — see if anyone won.

### **Step 4. Text/UI**

* Keep ASCII-style displays (troop count bars, terrain map, morale indicators).
* Example:

  ```
  ⚔️  BATTLEFIELD  ⚔️
  Player Army:  ████████ (80%)
  Enemy Army:   ████░░░░ (40%)
  Terrain: Hill  |  Weather: Rain
  ```

### Porting the Tec-WareGame to Your Z80 Forth System

Based on the README for Tec-WareGame (a compact text adventure inspired by Zork-style games, implemented in Forth for resource-constrained environments like the Z80), it's a great fit for your setup. The game uses a simple noun-verb parser to interpret player input (e.g., "TAKE LAMP" becomes VERB: TAKE + NOUN: LAMP), a dictionary for vocabulary compression, and procedural room/object descriptions to minimize stored text. It emphasizes dynamic generation over pre-written strings, which aligns perfectly with your 2K RAM limit—leaving ~1-1.5K for game logic, vocab, and a buffer for responses.

I'll outline a step-by-step porting plan, focusing on space-saving techniques like noun-verb processing (already central to the original). This keeps the core adventure loop intact: explore rooms, manipulate objects, solve puzzles, with flavorful responses emerging from templates + keywords. Assume your Forth is ANS-like with basic dict words; adapt as needed.

#### 1. **Core Architecture: Reuse the Original's Structure**
   - **Memory Layout (Fits in 2K)**:
     - Vocab dictionary: 256-512 bytes (50-100 words, hashed or linear search).
     - Game state: 256 bytes (current room, inventory bitflags, flags for puzzles).
     - Room data: 512 bytes (procedural gen via IDs + short descriptors).
     - Parser & engine: 512 bytes (core loop + response templates).
     - Text buffer/output: 256 bytes (for building responses on-the-fly).
     - Spare: 256+ bytes for expansion (e.g., more puzzles).
   - **Why it fits**: The original avoids full sentence storage by tokenizing input and matching against a compact grammar. No need for bloated parsers like Inform—pure Forth words handle it.

   - **Bootstrap the Engine**:
     Start with a main loop Forth word:
     ```
     : MAIN-LOOP ( -- )
        BEGIN
           ." > " INPUT-BUFFER PARSE-INPUT  \ Read line into buffer
           DUP IF PROCESS-COMMAND ELSE ." WHAT?" CR THEN
           GAME-STATE @ RUN-ACTION  \ Update world, print response
           BYE? UNTIL ;  \ Check quit flag
     ```
     This is ~50 bytes compiled. `PARSE-INPUT` splits into words; `PROCESS-COMMAND` matches verb/noun.

#### 2. **Implement Noun-Verb Parsing for Space Savings**
   - **Key Insight**: Instead of storing 100s of full responses ("You take the lamp. It is shiny."), use **templates** + **substitutions**. Process input as VERB (action) + NOUN (target), then fill a response skeleton. This cuts text by 70-80%—store ~20 short templates (e.g., "You {ACTION} the {OBJECT}.") and swap in keywords.
   
   - **Parser Forth Code** (~150 bytes):
     ```
     CREATE VERB-DICT 0 ,  \ Dynamic array: verb-word -> ID (e.g., TAKE=1)
     : ADD-VERB ( addr len id -- ) VERB-DICT +! ;  \ Build at compile-time
     \ Pre-load: S" TAKE" 1 ADD-VERB S" GO" 2 ADD-VERB etc.

     CREATE NOUN-DICT 0 ,  \ Similar for nouns: LAMP=10, DOOR=11
     : FIND-WORD ( addr len dict-addr -- id | 0 )
        DUP @ SWAP  \ Get count
        0 DO DUP I CELLS + @ = IF I LEAVE THEN LOOP DROP 0 ;

     : PARSE-INPUT ( addr len -- verb-id noun-id )
        >IN !  \ Reset input pointer
        BL WORD  \ First word (verb)
        VERB-DICT FIND-WORD -> VERB-ID
        BL WORD  \ Second word (noun)
        NOUN-DICT FIND-WORD -> NOUN-ID
        2DROP ;  \ Clean stack
     ```
     - Usage: Input "GO NORTH" → VERB-ID=2, NOUN-ID= (direction as special noun).
     - Handles basics: 2-word inputs. For extras (e.g., "INVENTORY"), flag as special verb=0.
     - Space hack: Dicts as packed strings (e.g., 8-char max/word) or hashed (XOR len for 1-byte lookup).

   - **Error Handling**: If no match, default to "I DON'T UNDERSTAND {VERB} {NOUN}."—build from input echo, no extra storage.

#### 3. **Dynamic Text Responses: Templates for Flavor Without Bloat**
   - **Template System** (~100 bytes): Store 10-15 short response frames as counted strings in a dict. Use Forth's `S" ` for compile-time literals, but compress with abbreviations (e.g., "Y{0} TK {1}. IT {2}." where {0}=OU, {1}=HE LMP, {2}=SHNY).
   
     Example templates:
     ```
     CREATE RESP-TEMPLATES 0 ,
     : ADD-TEMP ( addr len id -- ) RESP-TEMPLATES +! ;

     \ At compile: S" YOU TAKE THE " 1 ADD-TEMP S" LAMP. IT GLOWS." 1 ADD-TEMP
     S" YOU GO " 2 ADD-TEMP S" NORTH. A DARK ROOM." 2 ADD-TEMP
     \ More: 5-10 per action type (take, drop, look, etc.)
     ```
     
     - **Build Response**:
       ```
       : BUILD-RESPONSE ( verb-id noun-id -- addr len )
          2DUP VALID-ACTION? IF  \ Check if action possible (e.g., lamp in room?)
             SWAP VERB-ID * NOUN-ID + CELLS RESP-TEMPLATES + @  \ Get template ID
             >R  \ Temp stack
             S" BASE-TEXT"  \ e.g., "YOU {VERB} THE {NOUN}."
             R> CASE  \ Switch on action
                1 OF S" TAKE" SUBST S" LAMP" IF IN-INVENTORY? THEN S" . NOW CARRIED." ENDOF
                2 OF S" GO" SUBST S" NORTH" SUBST ." DARK HERE." ENDOF
                \ ENDCASE with defaults
          ELSE S" HUH?" THEN ;
       
       : SUBST ( template-addr len keyword-addr len -- new-addr len )  \ String replace
          \ Simple: PAD ! PLACE (copy) FIND REPLACE CMOVE ;  \ ~50 bytes
       ```
     - **Flavor Boost**: Add randomness/variation with a PRNG (e.g., Z80 R register seed):
       ```
       VARIABLE RNG  \ Init: ZP@ RNG !
       : RANDOM ( n -- rand ) RNG @ 5 LSHIFT RNG +! RNG @ MOD ;
       ```
       Pick from 2-3 variants per template: "The lamp glows softly." or "It flickers ominously."—store as alt strings, select via `RANDOM 2 MOD`.
     
     - **Output**: `BUILD-RESPONSE TYPE CR` dumps to console. For your SBCRunning, hook to serial/ screen driver.

   - **Room Descriptions**: Procedural, not stored full-text.
     ```
     CREATE ROOMS 0 ,  \ Room ID -> short code (e.g., 1=DARK-CAVE)
     : DESCRIBE-ROOM ( room-id -- addr len )
        CASE 1 OF S" YOU ARE IN A CAVE. EXITS: N." ENDOF
              2 OF S" KITCHEN. ITEMS: LAMP." ENDOF
              S" UNKNOWN PLACE." ENDCASE ;
     ```
     Expand with flags: If puzzle solved, append "DOOR UNLOCKED." Saves 100s of bytes vs. fixed strings.

#### 4. **Game Logic: Minimal State Machine**
   - **Actions Table** (~200 bytes): Map verb+noun to effects.
     ```
     : DO-ACTION ( verb noun -- )
        16 * + CELLS ACTIONS + @ EXECUTE ;  \ Jump table
     
     : TAKE-LAMP ( -- ) LAMP-FLAG 1 OR GAME-STATE +! ." GOT IT!" ;
     ' TAKE-LAMP 1 CELLS 10 + ACTIONS !  \ Index for TAKE+LAMP
     ```
     - Puzzles: Bitflags for state (e.g., bit 0=has-lamp, bit 1=door-open). Triggers conditional responses: `HAS-LAMP? IF S" IT LIGHTS UP." THEN`.
     - Win/Lose: Simple counter for score/death.

#### 5. **Optimization & Testing Tips**
   - **Compress Further**:
     - Use 4-6 bit codes for common words (pack dict into bytes).
     - No floating vocab—hardcode 40 core words (20 verbs, 20 nouns).
     - Responses under 80 chars; use abbreviations in templates (expand on output if needed).
   - **Forth-Specific**:
     - Compile cold (dictionary-packed) to shave bytes.
     - Test incrementally: Port parser first, then one room, add responses.
     - Your 2K leaves room for 5-10 rooms, 10 objects, branching puzzles—enough for a "ware" (wireframe?) adventure with tech/mystery theme.
   - **Enhance Interest**: 
     - Procedural events: Timer (via Z80 ticks) for random encounters ("A shadow moves!").
     - Branching: Noun-verb combos unlock jokes/secrets (e.g., "EXAMINE SELF" → "YOU ARE HUNGRY Z80 SOUL.").

This ports ~80% of the original's feel while fitting snugly. If you share your Forth's exact dict size or a code snippet, I can refine (e.g., via code_execution tool for sim). Start with the parser—it's the space-saver! What's your first focus: vocab or rooms?
